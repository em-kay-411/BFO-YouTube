Authentication works on JWT tokens 

Signup requires the username, email, password and role to be entered.
During login, local strategy is used for logging in and a JWT is generated and given out as a response.
Need to look after how this JWT token can be taken retained accross routes.
The token needs to be sent as a header to every request.
